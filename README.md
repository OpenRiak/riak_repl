# BEAM release process

1. git tag the specific commit(s) that will be released
2. run all eunit tests, EQC tests, store the output in a gist.
3. if possible, run all riak_tests for replication
4. record specific commit(s) that the beam targets in a README.txt file
5. create a tar file. 
  - Note that OSX will include a hidden directory in the tar file. Find the knob to prevent those files from being added to the .tar file, or build/test the beams on Linux. (you can use 'find' to pipe the exact files you want into the tar, see: https://github.com/basho/node_package/blob/develop/priv/templates/fbsd/Makefile#L27 for an example of using -rf with a pipe)
  - include the README.txt file from the step above
6. once .tar is built, calc an MD5 to pass along with the file
7. create an entry on https://github.com/basho/internal_wiki/wiki/Releases page
	- include:
		- link to the gist output
		- version of Erlang the beams were built with
		- MD5 of the file
		- link to compiled beams		
8. notify client services + TAMs
9. port the PR to the `develop` branch if applicable
